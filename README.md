# Solana-fiat 

It takes advantages of Solana fast transaction speed to make (nearly) realtime fiat virtual card issuance come true. Having said that, Solana in specific, is helping the whole Blochain ecosystem moving forward with more practical & useful application.

### Problem 
- Create a visa card with bank taking a long time and many requirements, step verify 
- Lost a visa card how to return? (call to bank, not sure 100% return)
- Buy some service which you dont want bank know your transaction or some website which you cannot trust 100%
- Send Gifts to your friends, family, or you are the company and send to all your customers 

### Our solution 
- Create a visa card instantly just connect to your solana wallet 
- Create multiple visa card with one same wallets, delete the visa card if you dont want to use
- Get back till 1% when you success create a new transaction or new card (you get our token is created based on solan, able to convert to solana)
